First of all I would like to express my gratitude for providing me an opportunity to demonstrate my skills.
I am Mayuresh Shitole, full-stack developer graduated in MSc Computer Engineering from University of Essex,
currently I am not working anywhere and trying to get into the industry to excel and use my skills for a great products that can add values to te society.
While searching for a job opportunities I stumble upon a job post on LinkedIn and after reading it carefully I did some research about QA Wolf. 
I really liked the mission and a product whatever I understood by the website and I realize that my skills can also contribute towards this and makes a great difference for a clients with my previous experience of handling clients 
and as declared on the website huge companies reduced their QA spends and increased development capacity drastically, this impressed me .
I really liked the company profile and want to contribute towards such a great Platform-enabled service and I am exited for further process and hungry to gain knowledge and work harder.
Again thank you for consideration of my application, I am looking forwards to hear from you soon.

Thanks and Regards,
